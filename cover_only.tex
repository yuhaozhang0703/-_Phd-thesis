  This thesis is the result of many years of research into how to format
  a document using \LaTeX. It contains examples and recommendations on
  what packages to use and how to use them. It makes no attempt to be
  an introduction to \LaTeX. Indeed some basic \LaTeX{} knowledge is assumed. 
  It is geared to (particle) physics theses, but may be useful for others.
  In order to make the abstract longer, we simply repeat it!
